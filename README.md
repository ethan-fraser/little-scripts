## Little Scripts

A collection of little scripts and things written for fun or for educational purposes.

Most of them are self explanatory but the others are explained below.

### Overview
###### process_scheduling.py
A program to generate Gantt charts for various process scheduling algorithms (all specified in the file). Also calculates completion, turnaround, burst and wait times for processes, and shows a real time representation of the queue.
###### lzw.py
An implementation of the LZW compression and decompression algorithms on a string. Gives data about compressed data's length as a percentage of the original.
###### rle.py
A bitwise implementation of the run length encoding compression algorithm. When I say bitwise I mean it works on a string of ones and zeroes. Also gives data about the compressed data's length as a percentage of the original.
###### sll.py
A basic singly linked list implementation.
###### sorting
Heap sort and the python version of selection sort take the name of a line separated file of numbers as a command line argument and sorts them. They don't provide timing information.
The C ones all take a whitespace seperated string of numbers from stdin and output them sorted. They also give information to stderr about timing.
